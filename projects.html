            <p>Throughout my years in the Ohio State University, I have
                been part of teams that made wonderful softwares. My projects include:
                the creatation of 2D Mario Game, an android application called Walkbuddy,
                and a current work in progress 3D game that manipulates shadow. Aside from
                team projects, I also have multiple individual projects. One of which is an 
                application that generate curves. These softwares are all available in my
                Github page for viewing.

            <h2>Mario Game 2D</h2>
            <p>A team of 4 people were required to recreate this game. team contributions
                are all listed in my Github page. Aside from simply recreating the game, we 
                also added new features such as infinite levels, bat powered mario, and new
                type of enemies. I was mainly in charge of the mario character himself, along
                with the items that he can interact with. This game was made with MonoGame and 
                written in C#.

                <h2>3D Shadow Focused Game</h2>
                <p>This is an original platformer game made with Unity that focuses on 2D. The goal of 
                    the game is to manipulate the 3D world with a separate 3D character to essentially 
                    change how the shadow is casted onto the wall so that the 2D character may proceed. 
                    The game is technically challenging itself as it draws any 3D object inside the game 
                    scene into a playable and interactable 2D character on the wall. If the object was 
                    moved or altered in 3D, the 2D shadow casted onto the wall would change as well. 
                    The screenshots given are only prototypes. The game will be done in April 2018.
